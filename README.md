# **HackerGame v1.1**

Hackergame is an interactive, command-line hacking simulation game where players take on the role of a hacker. Players gain experience (XP), unlock new hacking techniques, and exploit various targets to accumulate in-game cryptocurrency known as CryptoCoins. The game features an immersive command-line interface (CLI) that gives players the feel of working inside a real hacker terminal.

---

## **Features**
- **Command-line Interface**: Interact with the game using text commands, mimicking a real hacker's terminal environment.
- **Autocomplete System**: Type commands and receive suggestions with dynamic autocompletion, powered by the **Auto Complete Menu Node** plugin by **Lenrow**.
- **XP-Based Unlock System**: Gain XP and unlock powerful new hacking techniques like `buffer_overflow` and `xss_injection`.
- **Dynamic Risk System**: Each target has a unique risk level, difficulty, and potential reward.
- **Trace and Security**: Be careful—each failed hack increases your trace level. If your trace level reaches the threshold, you'll lose CryptoCoins.
- **Vendor System**: Access the White Market to buy hacking tools like VPNs, Antivirus, and more soon!
- **Passive Tool Effects**: Tools like VPNs passively reduce trace, while Antivirus reduces the chance of spyware infections.
- **Player Inventory**: Purchased tools are stored in your inventory, which you can view at any time.
- **Open Source**: This project is 100% open source, and we welcome contributors from all backgrounds.

## **Autocomplete System**
**Hackergame** utilizes the **Auto Complete Menu Node** plugin by **Lenrow** for autocomplete functionality.

### **How It Works**
- As you type commands, the autocomplete system suggests matching commands, target IDs, and techniques.
- The autocomplete system uses a **`terms.json`** file to populate the list of possible commands, targets, and other suggestions.
- All commands, targets, and techniques are included in this file to ensure a smooth user experience.
